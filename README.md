# canonical_company_names_challenge
For applying to SmallWorld

The code can be run in two ways: <br>
I have included a Jupyter notebook with the full code.  <br>
There is a python file, which can be run from the command line. To correctly run the script, the command line execution will take the form:  <br>
python canonical_company_names_challenge.py company-names.csv results.csv True  <br>
Where the first argument provided is the filepath for the CSV, the second argument is the destination for the results to be written to, 
and the third argument is a boolean to determine whether or not the output should be verbose.
